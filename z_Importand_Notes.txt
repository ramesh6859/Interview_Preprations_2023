Selecting the Microcontroller and Microprocessor.
================================================
1.  Speed.
2.  Packaging.
3.  Power Consumption.
4.  The size of RAM and ROM on the chip.
5.  The number of I/O pins and the timer on the chip.
6.  How easy to upgrade to higher performance or lower power consumption versions.
7.  Cost per unit.
8.  Availability of software development tools such as compilers, assemblers and debuggers.

1.  Set the last bits of a input number
    example: (0,3) - 00000111
2.  Generate the binary of a number and get the mirror image of that binary number from the middle.
3.  Swap two nibbles.
4.  String Manipulation
    a3[b]c  -   abbbc
    abc2[pq]    -   abcpqpq

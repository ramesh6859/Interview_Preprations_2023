Macro Function
    1.  Macro functions are expanded by the preprocessor at the compile time.
    2.  Expressions passed to the Macro functions might get evaluated more than once.
    3.  Macro functions do not follow strict parameter data type checking.
    4.  Macro functions are hard to debug because it is replaced by the pre-processor as a textual representation which is not visible in the source code.

Inline Function
    1.  Inline functions are expanded by the compiler.
    2.  Expressions passed to Inline functions get evaluated once.
    3.  Inline functions follow strict data type checking of the parameters.
    4.  Easier to debug inline functions which is why it is recommended to be used over macro functions.

Reentrant Function
    1.  A function is called reentrant if the function can be interrupted in the middle of the execution and be safely called again (re-entered) to complete the execution. 
    2.  The interruption can be in the form of external events or signals or internal signals like call or jump. 
    3.  The reentrant function resumes at the point where the execution was left off and proceeds to completion.

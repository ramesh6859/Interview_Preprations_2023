4 Steps of the Embedded (or IoT) Product Development Life Cycle
    
Step 1. Planning and Analysis
    1.  Idea
    2.  The Need
    3.  Target Audience
    4.  Requirements
    5.  Competitors
    6.  Concept

Step 2. Designing
    1.  Architecture
        Should reflect hardware and software components that in combination will ensure the performance of target functions.
    2.  Technical Resources
        1.  Development Kits
        2.  Software Development Tools
    3.  Development Team
        1.  Embedded software engineer
        2.  Hardware engineer
        3.  PCB layout engineer
        4.  Mechanical engineer
        
Step 3. Implementation
    1.  Alpha Prototype
        A raw product that reveals functional issues and requires certain adjustments.
    2.  Beta Prototype
        A version that is ready for production.

Step 4. Commercial Launch
    1.  Procurement of components and setting up the manufacturing.
    2.  Production
    3.  Post manufacturing testing
    4.  Assembling.
    5.  Shipping
    6.  Post-production support and maintenance.

CAN
1.	Multi master serial communication.
2.	Communication up to 1MB/S.
3.	Automatic retransmission of faulty messages.
4.	Automatic bus connection of nodes that are suspected to be physically faulty.
5.  Functional Addressing - data messages do not contain source or destination addresses, only identifiers relating to their function and/or priority.
6.  CAN is a broadcast type of Bus.
7.	All devices can hear the transmission.
8.  No way to send a data specifically to a node by its address or something.
9.  CAN Node.
    1.  Microcontroller which contains CAN controller.
    2.  Digital signals
        1.  Single ended pins.
        2.  Digital signals (CAN TX and CAN RX).
    3.  CAN transceiver.
    4.  Differential signals (CANH and CANL).
10. Recessive state
    1.  Logical 1 is also called as recessive state of the CAN bus.
    2.  In recessive state the potential difference between CANH and CANl is 0v.
    3.  Suppose VCC is 3v, CANH will be 2.3v and CANL will be 2.3v.
11. Dominant state
    1.  Logical 0 is also called as dominant state of the CAN bus.
    2.  In dominant state the potential difference between CANH and CANl is 2v.
    3.  In dominant state CANH will be VCC and CANL will be 1.25v.
    4.  Suppose VCC is 3.3v then the dominant state is 2.05v.
    5.  That is CANH is 3.3v and CANL is 1.25v.
    6.  Dominant bit is also called SOF bit.
12. Arbitration ID is 11 bit identifier.
13. Lower the arbitration ID number higher is the priority in the case of multiple nodes.
14. Data Frame of CAN protocol
    1.  Application must select one empty transmit mailbox.
    2.  Set up the identifier.
    3.  Set up the data length code.
    4.  Data before requesting the transmission.

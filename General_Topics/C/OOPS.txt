OOPs
    OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming System, a paradigm that provides concepts such as objects, classes, and inheritance.
    
    Following are the concepts introduced in OOPs:
    1.  Object
        A real-world entity having a particular state and behavior. We can define it as an instance of a class.
    2.  Class
        A logical entity that defines the blueprint from which an object can be created or instantiated.
    3.  Inheritance
        A concept that refers to an object gaining all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It provides code reusability.
    4.  Polymorphism
        A concept that allows a task to be performed in different ways. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
    5.  Abstraction
        A concept that hides the internal details of an application and only shows the functionality. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
    6.  Encapsulation
        A concept that refers to the wrapping of code and data together into a single unit.

ARM7 Modes
==========
Privileged Modes
    1.  Abort
        1.  Processor enters the abort mode when there is a failed attempt to access the memory.
    2.  Fast Interrupt Request (FIQ)
    3.  Interrupt Request (IRQ)
        1.  Processor enters the mode when there is an external interrupt.
        2.  These interrupt modes corresponds to two interrupt levels available on the ARM processor.
        3.  FIQ has higher priority than IRQ.
        4.  This means when core takes FIQ exception it automatically masks IRQ.
    4.  Supervisor
        1.  Mode the processor is in after reset and is generally the mode that an operating system kernel operates in. 
        2.  Additional privileges - greater control.
        3.  read I/O module.
    5.  System
        1.  Special version of user mode that allows full read write access to CPCR.
    6.  Undefined
        1.  Mode when the processor encounters an instruction that is undefined or not supported by implementation.

Non Privileged Modes
        Allows only read access to control field (Mode selection bites, Thumb selection bites and interrupt mask bits). 
        Allows read write access to conditional flags.
    7.  User
        1.  Mode used by programs or applications.
        2.  Most of the tasks are executed in this mode.
        3.  Memory access is restricted.
        4.  Hardware devices cannot read directly.

ARM Cortex-M4 Register Bank
    The Cortex-M microcontroller are based on the ARMv7 processor and this processor has a set of internal registers known as a register bank. This register bank consists of 16 registers ranging from R0-R16. First 13 registers from R0-12 are general purpose registers and last three from R12-R15 are special function registers.

    General Purpose Registers (GPR)
        General purpose registers are divided into two groups .i.e.  lower registers (R0-R7) and higher registers(R8-R12). 
        GPR are used to store addresses and data which is currently under process.

    Special Function Registers
        In special function registers, R13 (SP) is a stack pointer and it holds the address of the top element of the stack. 
        R14 is a link register LR and it is used to store the return address of the functions. 
        R15 (PC) is a program counter and it holds the address of the next instruction to be executed. 
        Program counter value automatically increases by 4 after every instruction execution so that it points to the next instruction address.

    Special Registers
        Other than register bank, the processor also has special registers that contain the program status such as operational status, system interrupts. 
        These status registers are:
            PSR ( Program status register)
            PRIMASK
            FAULTMASK
            BASEPRI
            CONTROL
    Cortex-M4 Main Components
        ARM Cortex-M4 based consists of the following main building blocks as mentioned below:
            Processor core
            NVIC (Nested Vector Interrupt Controller)
            Debug system
            Bus system and bus matrix
            Memory
            Peripheral

Selecting the Microcontroller and Microprocessor.
================================================
1.  Speed.
2.  Packaging.
3.  Power Consumption.
4.  The size of RAM and ROM on the chip.
5.  The number of I/O pins and the timer on the chip.
6.  How easy to upgrade to higher performance or lower power consumption versions.
7.  Cost per unit.
8.  Availability of software development tools such as compilers, assemblers and debuggers.
